# mapperbase
 Base mod for my Minecraft mods.
 
 This is a small mod that adds contents used by my other mods. This is to avoid duplicating elements between my other mods.
 By itself this mods only adds a few contents, usually without any explicit usage. It is best used with my other mods:
 
 EmbellishCraft: https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/embellishcraft
 Road Stuff 2: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/road-stuff
 
 Not: currently none of my mods are updated to 1.15 yet. Do not try to load them in a 1.15.1 instance. Wait for an update first.
 
 Targeted Minecraft version: 1.15.1
 Mod loader: Forge
